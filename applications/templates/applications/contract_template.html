        <div class="paragraph">
            Normal working hours will be from (08:00) to (16:30) from Mondays to Fridays.<br>
            The employer may not require or permit the employee to work more than forty-five (45) hours per week, calculated as follows:<br>
            Nine (9) hours on any day, if the employee works five (5) days or less a week; or<br>
            Eight (8) hours on any day if the employee works on more than five (5) days in a week; and<br>
            Lunch breaks are not included in this calculation.<br>
            Hours of work in terms of item 5.2 may be extended by up to fifteen (15) minutes a day, but may not exceed one (1) hour a week. The reason for this provision is to allow the employee to finish the task at hand, especially when serving a client, at the end of a working day.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Meal intervals:</strong><br>
            The employee is entitled to a lunch break of 30 minutes. Lunch breaks will be taken from 13:00 to 13:30 daily.<br><br>

            Pay the employee no less than the employee's ordinary wage for each hour of overtime worked and grant the employee at least thirty (30) minutes time off with full pay for every hour of overtime worked; or<br>
            The remuneration method above will be the normal method of remuneration. Should the employer need to use one of the other options due to circumstances, he/she will inform the employee accordingly, preferably in writing, before the commencement of overtime.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Work on Sundays and Public Holidays</strong><br>
            <strong>Sundays</strong><br>

            <strong>Public holidays</strong><br>

            If the parties agree that the employee should work on any of the above days, the employee shall be paid double the normal day's wage for a full day or double the hourly wage for every hour worked. The employer may also by agreement grant two (2) paid working days off in lieu of payment.<br><br>
            
            <strong>ANNUAL LEAVE</strong><br>
            The employee is entitled to (15) fifteen working days leave per annum. Leave will not be granted concurrently with any other period of sick leave granted. Leave will normally not be granted within the notice period regarding termination of service.<br>
            Leave may not be accumulated for more than eighteen (18) months, except where explicit written consent is obtained, detailing the amount of leave which may be accumulated. Motivated written application must be made to obtain such consent.<br>
            Leave accumulated in terms of special permission referred to above will not be paid out at termination of service.<br>
            Leave must be applied for in writing in the form and manner prescribed by the company from time to time, and may only be taken approval by the company or its delegated authority.<br><br>
            
            <strong>SICK LEAVE</strong><br>
            During every sick leave cycle (12 months) the employee will be entitled to an amount of sick leave equal to the number of days the employee would normally work during a period of four (4) weeks.<br>
            The employee will therefore be entitled to ten (10) days sick leave over a period of twelve (12) months (1 years).<br>
            During the first six (6) months of employment the employee is entitled to one day's paid sick leave for every twenty-one (21) days worked.<br>
            In the case where the employee is unable to attend work due to medical reasons, the employee must ensure that the company is notified as soon as reasonably possible.<br>
            An application for sick leave must be supported by a certificate from a registered medical practitioner.<br><br>
            
            <strong>FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES LEAVE</strong><br>
            The employee will be entitled to three (3) days family responsibility leave during each leave cycle (12 months).<br>
            The employer is only obliged to grant family responsibility leave under the following circumstances:<br>
            1. When the employee's child is born; or<br>
            2. When the employee's child is sick; or<br>
            3. In the event of death of the employee's spouse or life partner, parent or adoptive parent, grandparent, child, adopted child, grandchild or sibling.<br><br>
            
            <strong>LEAVE WITHOUT REMUNERATION</strong><br>
            Leave without remuneration may be granted when the employee's:<br>
            1. Sick leave credits are insufficient or have been depleted; or<br>
            2. Application for sick leave cannot be reasonably substantiated; or<br>
            3. Family responsibility leave credits are insufficient or have been depleted and no vacation leave credits are available.<br>
            The employee may apply in writing to be granted leave without remuneration for an extended period not exceeding six (6) months in exceptional circumstances. The application will be fully motivated. The employer is not obliged to approve such an application.<br>
            If the employee is absent from duty without prior arrangement or permission, the employer may regard any period of such absence as leave without remuneration. This does not preclude the employer from taking disciplinary measures against the employee in terms of this contract.<br>
            Leave without remuneration will affect the accumulation of vacation leave credits on a pro-rata basis.<br>
            Leave without remuneration may affect the calculation of any bonus or reward that the employer may contemplate.<br><br>
            
            <strong>DEDUCTIONS FROM REMUNERATION</strong><br>
            The employer may not deduct any monies from the employee's salary unless the employee has agreed thereto in this contract or in writing on each occasion.
