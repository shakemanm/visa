        <div class="paragraph">
            {{ applicant.title }} {{ applicant.surname }}'s prospective employment will be based on {{ applicant.his_her }} substantial experience, exceptional abilities, and unwavering determination rather than formal qualifications.

            The candidate possesses extensive experience that will be demonstrated once {{ applicant.he_she }} begins working as our {{ applicant.job_profile.title|default:"[POSITION]" }}.

        <div class="regulation">3. Regulation 16 (4) (d):</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Before commencing employment, {{ applicant.title }} {{ applicant.surname }} will provide evidence of {{ applicant.his_her }} legal status in the country, ensuring full compliance with all regulatory prerequisites.

        <div class="regulation">4. Regulation 16 (4) (e):</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            We have not advertised this position as it has been created specifically to meet our need for a full-time {{ applicant.job_profile.title|default:"[POSITION]" }}. Based on {{ applicant.title }} {{ applicant.surname }}'s demonstrated skills during the interview process, we are confident {{ applicant.he_she }} will prove to be the ideal candidate for this role.
